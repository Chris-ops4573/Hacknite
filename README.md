## Problem Statement
IIITB students often seek a platform to share thoughts, seek help, or engage in open discussions without the pressure of being identified. Existing platforms either lack anonymity, are too formal, or are disconnected from the unique context of IIITB campus life. There's a gap for a safe, anonymous, and IIITB-exclusive space where students can freely express themselves on everything from academics to casual campus talk.
